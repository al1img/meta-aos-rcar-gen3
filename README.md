# meta-aos-rcar-gen3

This repository contains Renesas RCAR Gen3-specific Yocto layers for
Aos distro and `moulin` project file to build it. Layers in this
repository provide final recipes to build meta-xt-prod-aos-rcar
distro. This distro is the Aos product for Renesas boards.

Those layers *may* be added and used manually, but they were written
with [Moulin](https://moulin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) build system,
as Moulin-based project files provide correct entries in local.conf

## Status

This is initial revision 1.0.0 based on meta-aos revision 5.2.1.

## Moulin project file

Work is still in progress, but right now the following features are tested and working:

* AosBox with Starter Kit Premiere 8GB board
* 3 domains are being built: Linux based Dom0, DomD and DomF where DomF is main Aos domain
* Networking in DomD and DomF
* OP-TEE client in DomF
* Virtualized OP-TEE build
* ARM-TF that boots into EL2
* SD or eMMC boot

Features that are present but not tested:

* Renesas Salvator-XS M3 with 8GB memory is supported
* Renesas Salvator-X H3 with 8GB memory is supported
* Renesas Starter Kit Premiere 8GB (H3ULCB)
* Kingfisher with Starter Kit Premiere 8GB board
* Renesas Salvator-XS M3 with 4GB memory
* Renesas Salvator-XS H3 with 8GB memory
* Renesas Starter Kit Premiere (H3ULCB)
* Renesas Starter Kit Pro (M3ULCB)

## Building

### Requirements

1. Ubuntu 18.0+ or any other Linux distribution which is supported by Poky/OE
2. Development packages for Yocto. Refer to [Yocto
   manual](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#brief-build-system-packages).
3. You need `Moulin` installed in your PC. Recommended way is to
   install it for your user only: `pip3 install --user
   git+https://github.com/xen-troops/moulin`. Make sure that your
   `PATH` environment variable includes `${HOME}/.local/bin`.
4. Ninja build system: `sudo apt install ninja-build` on Ubuntu

### Fetching

You can fetch/clone this whole repository, but you actually need only
one file from it: `aos-rcar-gen3.yaml`. During build `moulin` will
fetch this repository again into `yocto/` directory. So, to avoid
possible confusion, we recommend to download only `aos-rcar-gen3.yaml`:

```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aoscloud/meta-aos-rcar-gen3/master/aos-rcar-gen3.yaml
```

### Building

Moulin is used to generate Ninja build file: `moulin aos-rcar-gen3.yaml`.
This project provides a number of additional options. You can use check them
with `--help-config` command line option:

```sh
moulin aos-rcar-gen3.yaml --help-config
usage: /home/oleksandr_grytsov/.local/bin/moulin aos-rcar-gen3.yaml
   [--MACHINE {h3ulcb-4x2g-ab,h3ulcb-4x2g,h3ulcb-4x2g-kf,m3ulcb,salvator-x-m3,salvator-xs-m3-2x4g,salvator-xs-h3,salvator-xs-h3-4x2g,salvator-x-h3-4x2g,salvator-x-h3}]
   [--VIS_DATA_PROVIDER {telemetryemulator,renesassimulator}]

Config file description: Aos development setup for Renesas RCAR Gen3 hardware

optional arguments:
  --MACHINE {h3ulcb-4x2g-ab,h3ulcb-4x2g,h3ulcb-4x2g-kf,m3ulcb,salvator-x-m3,salvator-xs-m3-2x4g,salvator-xs-h3,salvator-xs-h3-4x2g,salvator-x-h3-4x2g,salvator-x-h3}
                        RCAR Gen3-based device
  --VIS_DATA_PROVIDER {telemetryemulator,renesassimulator}
                        Sepecifieds plugin for VIS automotive data
```

To build for AosBox use the following command line: `moulin aos-rcar-gen3.yaml`.

Moulin will generate `build.ninja` file. After that - run `ninja` to
build the images. This will take some time and disk space, as it will
built 3 separate Yocto images. Depending on internet speed, this will
take 2-4 hours on Intel i7 with 32GB of RAM and 100 GB SSD.

### Creating SD card image

Image file can be created with `rouge` tool. This is a companion
application for `moulin`.

It can be invoked either as a standalone tool, or via Ninja.

#### Creating image(s) via Ninja

Newer versions of `moulin` (>= 0.5) will generate additional Ninja targets:

* `image-full`

Thus, you can just run `ninja image-full` or `ninja full.img` which
will generate the `full.img` in your build directory.

Then you can use `dd` to write this image to your SD card. Don't
forget `conv=sparse` option for `dd` to speed up writing.

#### Using `rouge` in standalone mode

In this mode you can write image right to SD card. But it requires
additional options.

In standalone mode`rouge` accepts the same parameters like
`--MACHINE` as `moulin` does.

You can prepare image by running:

```sh
rouge aos-rcar-gen3.yaml -i full
```

This will create file `full.img` in your current directory.

Also you can write image directly to a SD card by running:

```sh
sudo rouge aos-rcar-gen3.yaml -i full -so /dev/sdX
```

**BE SURE TO PROVIDE CORRECT DEVICE NAME**. `rouge` have no
interactive prompts and will overwrite your device right away.
**ALL DATA WILL BE LOST**.

For more information about `rouge` check its
[manual](https://moulin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rouge.html).

## Aos FOTA update

### Prerequisites

* Proper board configuration file should be set for the target systemd on the Aos cloud. doc/boardconfig.json contains
board configuration for `h3ulcb-4x2g-ab` board. For other boards, component ids should be changed according to the
following scheme: `${AOS_BOARD_MODEL}-${AOS_BOARD_VERSION}-dom[0,d,f]`;
* Updating Dom0 requires special u-boot environment variables to be set: see doc/u-boot-env.md;
* Updating Dom0 works for eMMC only.

### Generating Aos update image

Aos update image generation is done by dom0 yocto. The Aos image requires
moulin build is successfully done. It means, after doing any source changes,
`ninja` build command should be issued before generating the Aos image.

The following commands should be performed to generate the Aos image:

```sh
cd yocto/
source poky/oe-init-build-env build-dom0/
bitbake aos-update
```

It will generate Aos update image according to the Aos update variables set in
`prod-aos-rcar.yaml` file. The default image location is your top build
folder.

Aos update variables:

* `AOS_BUNDLE_IMAGE_VERSION` - specifies image version of all components included to
the Aos update image. Individual component version can be assigned using
`AOS_DOM0_IMAGE_VERSION` for Dom0, `AOS_DOMD_IMAGE_VERSION` for DomD, `AOS_DOMF_IMAGE_VERSION` for DomF;
* `AOS_BUNDLE_OSTREE_REPO` - specifies path to ostree repo. ostree repo is required to generate incremental update.
It is set to `${TOPDIR}/../../rootfs_repo` by default;
* `AOS_BUNDLE_REF_VERSION` - used as default reference version for generating
incremental component update. Individual component reference version can be
specified using corresponding component variable: `AOS_DOMD_REF_VERSION` for DomD, `AOS_DOMF_REF_VERSION` for DomF;
* `AOS_BUNDLE_DOM0_TYPE`, `AOS_BUNDLE_DOMD_TYPE`, `AOS_BUNDLE_DOMF_TYPE` - specifies component update type:
  * `full` - full component update;
  * `incremental` - incremental component update (supported only by DomD, DomF);
  * if not set - the component update will not be included into the Aos update
image.

### Generating Aos update image example

* perform required changes in the sources;
* change the `AOS_BUNDLE_IMAGE_VERSION`;
* set components build type if required (`AOS_BUNDLE_DOM0_TYPE`, `AOS_BUNDLE_DOMD_TYPE`, `AOS_BUNDLE_DOMF_TYPE`);
* perform moulin build by issuing `ninja` build command;
* generate Aos image update as described above.
